# Deep Learning Image Classification on MNIST Dataset using Classic Convolutional Neural Network model
## Project Overview
This project aims to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional layers. 
The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 
The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify these digits based on the input images.
